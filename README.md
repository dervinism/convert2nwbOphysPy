# convert2nwbOphysPy
Python functions to convert calcium imaging data and associated intracellular electrophysiology data to Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) file format.

PyNWB installation instructions are available [here](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install_users.html). Other dependencies include numpy, scipy, datetime, which often come preinstalled.

To get the code with the accompanying example data and test it, download [GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki) repository [calcium-imaging-mock-repo](https://gin.g-node.org/dervinism/calcium-imaging-mock-repo).
